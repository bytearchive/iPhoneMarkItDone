This is a work-in-progress iPhone client for http://markitdone.com

It's been build with iOS 5.1 SDK and it uses RestKit 0.10.0 (//http://restkit.org).

It's been mostly a training ground for me for using some more advanced RestKit concepts (e.g. custom fetched results controllers), but I 
hope I'll finish it some day.
